## About The Repository

The Salesforce Releases Repository provides hands-on implementations of new enhancements and updates with each Salesforce release. The goal is to provide educational material to familiarize users with the application of new Salesforce capabilities. Some elements may only serve as visual enhancements and do not carry any functional significance; they are used exclusively for the appearance of specific implementations.

Please note that none of the implementations include permission settings, so developers who want to deploy the implementations in their environments need to configure permissions themselves. Additionally, some of the demo items may contain integrations with third-party providers. However, for security purposes, you must use keys that you generate yourself. All integrations are based on free services, so you should not encounter any issues obtaining them.

You can find more detailed information for each of the implementations in the `README.md` of each of the branches.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

- Using the GitHub interface, view a list of all available branches, each representing a specific implementation of a particular Salesforce release.
- Each branch contains its own `README.md` file, detailing all the manual steps and recommendations for deployment.
- Typically, each implementation is separated into its own custom tab that includes all the necessary elements, minimizing the risk of your code corruption. However, implementations often include a test data set that needs to be created, so using a test environment is still recommended.
